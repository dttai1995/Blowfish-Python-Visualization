# Blowfish-Python-Visualization
Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm using Python 3.x

A blowfish implementation is taken from .... and remove some unneeded implementation to make it easier to understand.

In this project, I use Tkinter as the main library for GUI, design some basic element such as Entry, Button, Label to show and visualize the algorithm in the way I understand.

Feel free to copy it because I do it as my homework, not for work or any evil purposes.

Workers of the world, unite!
